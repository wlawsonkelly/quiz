javascript quiz about random facts

please follow the comments to show how I did this HW

On this assignment I made a quiz with three questions. The quiz is timed (50 seconds) and you get - 10 seconds per wrong answer.

The quiz resets entirely without loading the page.

Mostly everything is done is JS

I use bootstrap to make the page responsive.
